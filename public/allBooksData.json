    "review": "In the last two days, I opened 3-4 books and read them a little bit. If you read a book in your own language, you may find a different peace. It liquidated me inside. It is the most detailed of all the contemporary memoirs I have read in the 1970s. Akhtaruzzaman Ilyas wrote in his diary about the mass uprising of 69 but did not add anything about 71. Sufia Kamal's diary was not as big in length as this one but good. Humayun Ahmed and Zafar Iqbal's memoirs about their father and 71, the part written by Humayun Ahmed, as always, was an attempt to create a feeling in his writing. Jahanara Imam's writing focuses on many areas.",
